A simple python IRC bot for my own amusement
============================================

CLI args
========

You can invoke the bot using the run.py script. It takes the following
arguments/flags.

-c --config   A json file specifying configuration options. This is by
              far the easiest way to get up and running!
-s --server   The server to connect to
-p --port     The port to connect to
-n --nick     The nick the bot will use
-a --nickserv The name of nickserv on the network you're connecting to
-w --password The password for nickserv
-v --verbose  Turn on verbose logging (see every message)

The run.py script will also take the name of its owner and a list of channels. These will
probably need to be escaped from a BASH terminal as it likes to interpret
# symbols as being special.

To connect to AberWiki and join #lolhax:

./run.py -s irc.aberwiki.org -p 6667 -a zippy -w secret overlord "#lolhax"

TODO list
=========

Allow setting command char from command line
Allow setting all config from a json config file
Write some more plugins
Add support for trigger functions
